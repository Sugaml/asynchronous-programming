## Illustration of Cigarette Smokers Problem

Assume a cigarette requires three ingredients to make and smoke: tobacco, paper, and matches.
There are three smokers around a table, each of whom has an infinite supply of one of the three ingredients â€”
one smoker has an infinite supply of tobacco, another has paper, and the third has matches. A fourth party, 
with an unlimited supply of everything, chooses at random a smoker, and put on the table the supplies needed for a cigarrette.
The chosen smoker smokes, and the process should repeat indefinitely.
